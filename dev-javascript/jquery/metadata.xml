		jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes
		things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling,
		animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works
		across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and
		extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write
		JavaScript.
